<h2>Cloning Jazzee</h2>
<p>If you're looking for the freshest Jazzee code you will have to *git* it 
  directly from our repository.  The only tricky step is making sure you get all 
  of the submodules too.</p>

  <pre>git clone git://github.com/Jazzee/Jazzee.git jazzee
cd jazzee
git submodule update --init --recursive</pre>
